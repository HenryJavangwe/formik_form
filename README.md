# Bime Front-End Coding challenge

## Overview & Instructions

Hello and welcome, Included on this folder are two files README.md file(for instructions), and a questions.json file for the data you will have to use for the challenge:

* Create a simple react application with a react CLI tool of your choosing.
* Using [Formik](https://formik.org/) create formik fields using the provided questions.json and display them on the application. 
* On the questions.json you'll find that some of the questions have conditions. use those conditions to display the question fields as required.
* If the question has no conditions, display the question by default.
* Please do not worry about the CSS(Look and Feel) of your application
* All the data should be save on the state and displayed above the form as you update the fields, respectively with their questions next to them.



## Submission instructions 
* Everything should be done on Github and shared with Tanaka Malaba at the completion of the challenge.
* Best Practices will be a bonus.

## All the best and hope to see you on the team.
